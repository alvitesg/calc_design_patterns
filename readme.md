Homework 5 - leveraging a simple calculator approach, I developed an app with commmands and then converted the architecture into plugins.
'''

##1. Set up command branch, which covers REPL (read, eval, print, loop) by adding four basis calculator commands: add, subtract, multiply, and divide.

##2. Set up a menu command, which involved dynamically passing the list of command names to a new MenuCommand so it can display available commands.

##3. Achieved near 100% in testing files
tests/__init__.py                       0      0   100%
tests/test_app.py                      16      0   100%
tests/test_commands.py                 28      0   100%

##4. Developed Plugin Architecture
